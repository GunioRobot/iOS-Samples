### Metronome ###

===========================================================================
DESCRIPTION:
Metronome sample application demonstrates how to animate a rotation, interpret touch events, and display a simple application preferences view. Open the Metronome project in Xcode and build and run it. To run in the simulator, set the Active SDK to Simulator. To run on a device, set the Active SDK to the appropriate Device setting.

The metronome presents a simple interface. Drag the arm horizontally to start the arm. Tap to stop. Drag the arm vertically to change the tempo. Tap the "i" button to access application preferences.

===========================================================================
BUILD REQUIREMENTS:

iOS 4.0 SDK

===========================================================================
RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS:

iPhone OS 3.2 or later

===========================================================================
PACKAGING LIST:

MetronomeAppDelegate.h
MetronomeAppDelegate.m
UIApplication's delegate. On start up, this object receives the applicationDidFinishLaunching: delegate message and creates an instance of MetronomeViewController and installs its view (the front side of the application) as a subview of the application's window. The MetronomeAppDelegate is also in charge of saving and restoring the user's time signature preference in user defaults.

MetronomeViewController.h
MetronomeViewController.m
Creates and controls the Metronome view.

MetronomeView.h
MetronomeView.m
This view builds the primary application UI. It also implements the touches... methods that respond to user interaction with that display. MetronomeView animates the swing of the arm and updates that animation to reflect changes in tempo, time signature, and sound settings.

PreferencesViewController.h
PreferencesViewController.m
Controls the Preferences View, which is loaded from PreferencesView.nib. In preferences, you can set the sound volume and time signature preferences.

SoundEffect.h
SoundEffect.m
A simple Objective-C wrapper around Audio Services functions that allow the loading and playing of sound files. 

MainWindow.xib
Interface Builder 'nib' file that provides the window for the application.

PreferencesView.xib
Nib file that provides the view for the preferences side of the application.
