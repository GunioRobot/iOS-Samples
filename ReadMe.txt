### ViewTransitions ###

================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:
The ViewTransitions sample application demonstrates how to perform transitions between two views using built-in Core Animation transitions. By looking at the code, you'll see how to use a CATransition object to set up and control transitions.

To try out the sample, build it using Xcode and run it in the simulator or on the device. Click the 'Transition' button to perform a transition from one image to another. The application choses a transition effect at random.
