iPhoneUnitTests illustrates the use of unit tests to ensure that an application’s functionality does not degrade as its source code undergoes changes to improve the application or to fix bugs. The project showcases two types of unit tests: logic and application. Logic unit tests allow for stress-testing source code. Application unit tests help ensure the correct linkage between user-interface controls, controller objects, and model objects.


Build Requirements:
iOS SDK 4.1 or later.


Runtime Requirements:
iOS OS 4.0 or later.


The iPhoneUnitTests project contains four targets:
- Calc.            Builds the Calc application, a simple arithmetic calculator.
- CalcTesting.     Builds the Calc application and embeds the CalcTests test
                   suite in it.
- CalcTests.       Builds the CalcTests test suite.
- CalculatorTests. Builds the CalculatorTests test suite.


Calc Target
The Calc target builds an iPhone application that implements a simple
calculator. The calculating engine is implemented in the Calculator class,
which has two main methods: input: and displayValue.

- input:.       This method accepts a one-character string as input.
                This string represents key presses.
- displayValue. This method provides the value representing the calculator’s
                output: As each key is pressed, the display value changes,
                as it would on a hardware-based calculator.

Important: Make sure that the Base SDK is set to iOS Device 4.1 for the project and all targets before running the tests.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
CalculatorTests Target
The CalculatorTests target builds a unit-test bundle containing logic tests.

Important: Logic-tests targets can be built only using the iPhone Simulator
SDK. You cannot build or run CalculatorTests using the iPhone Device SDK.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
CalcTests Target
The CalcTests target builds a unit-test bundle containing application tests.
You build as part of the target that builds the application to test. In this
case, the CalcTesting target.

Important: Application-tests targets cannot be built directly.

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
CalcTesting Target
The CalcTesting target is a copy of the Calc target. Its purpose is to build
the Calc application and embed the CalcTests test suite into it.

Important: Application targets with unit tests cannot be built or run using the
iPhone Simulator SDK; they can be built and run only using the iPhone Device
SDK. You cannot build or run CalcTesting using the iPhone Simulator SDK.

Running Logic Tests
To run the logic tests:
1. Choose Project > Set Active Target > CalculatorTests.
2. Choose Project > Set Active SDK > Simulator.
3. Choose Build > Build. Xcode runs the test cases implemented in
   the CalculatorTests.m file.
4. Choose Build > Build Results to open the Build Results window, containing
   the tests results. You may have to click the Show Transcript button (the
   third button on the bottom-left corner of the build results list) to view
   the build transcript.

The logic-tests results look similar to this:

Remember that logic tests are executed as part of the build process to provide
you with build errors for failed unit tests. Logic unit-test bundles are not
intented to run in iPhone Simulator or a device.

Running Application Tests
To run the application tests:
1. Choose Project > Set Active Target > CalcTesting.
2. Choose Project > Set Active SDK > Device.
3. Choose Build > Build and Run. Xcode builds the target, installs
   the application on your device, launches the application, runs the tests,
   and terminates the application.
4. Choose Run > Console to open the Console window, containing
   the test results.

The application-tests results look similar to this:
