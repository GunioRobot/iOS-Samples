SimpleDrillDown

================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

This application shows how to create a basic drill down interface.

The first screen shows a list of plays. When the user selects a play, the application displays a second screen that shows a list of the main characters and other data about the play. Both screens use a table view. The first list is in the "plain" style to show a standard list; the second is in the grouped style that you can use to lay out detail information.
