File: MyViewController.m
Abstract:  A UIViewController controller subclass that loads the MoviePlayer nib
file that contains its view.
 Instantiates a MPMoviePlayerController object, defines notification routines
that are called when the movie preroll has
 completed, when the movie has finished playing and when the movie scaling mode
is changed. Contains an action method that
 is called when the Play Movie button is pressed to play the movie. Updates and
saves the user settings for the currently
 set values. Overrides the inherited shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:
method so that the view can respond to device
 rotation.

Version: 1.2.1

    Now create a MPMoviePlayerController object using the movie file provided in our bundle.

    The MPMoviePlayerController class supports any movie or audio files that already play 
    correctly on an iPod or iPhone. For movie files, this typically means files with the extensions 
    .mov, .mp4, .mpv, and .3gp and using one of the following compression standards:

        - H.264 Baseline Profile Level 3.0 video, up to 640 x 480 at 30 fps. Note that B frames 
            are not supported in the Baseline profile.
        
        - MPEG-4 Part 2 video (Simple Profile)

    If you use this class to play audio files, it displays a black screen while the audio plays. For 
    audio files, this class class supports AAC-LC audio at up to 48 kHz.
